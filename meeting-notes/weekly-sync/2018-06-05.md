# Q&A

## Best approach to sharness tests?

need to integrate js-ipfs + go-ipfs

How does that look for the development teams?

go-ipfs has it's own sharness, js-ipfs as well.

Chris tried integrate with js-ipfs already.

How is the test/development flow?

Git submodules? Package? gx package? npm package?

## 

# Issues to create

- Setup Jenkinsfile for sharness to pull down go-ipfs to run with sharness
- Development flow with sharness
- how to actually do interface-ipfs-core tests cross-implementation
